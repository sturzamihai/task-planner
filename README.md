# :clipboard: Task Planner

> Final project for .NET with WinForms course.

Task management app that lets you create users, departments, projects and tasks.

## Features
* Create user accounts for employees, managers and clients
* Manage users in departments
* Add content-rich projects, with descriptions, start/end dates, departments and clients
* (WIP) Add and manage tasks with different customizable states
* Track time worked on tasks and update total time spent
* (WIP) See realtime statistics regarding number of tasks, tasks assigned per user, time tracked per tasks etc.

***Disclaimer**: This app is meant to immitate and feel like the user is working with a centralized Web App and Database. While it would not be a hard task to create a minmal Web API it would still be outside the project requirements.*
